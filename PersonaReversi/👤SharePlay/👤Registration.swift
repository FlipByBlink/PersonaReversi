The way an app exposes the group activity is done through the same way as starting SharePlay via AirDrop.
In iOS 17, you can start SharePlay via AirDrop by having a SharePlay app open.
To fetch the group activity, the system goes through the UI responder chain of the scene that is being shown and tries to find a group activity that is specified in the activity items configuration of one of the responders.
That way you can just set the group activity on the activity items configuration of a view controller that is showing SharePlayable content, and it will get picked up automatically.
To configure the Activity Items configuration, you start by creating the activity that can be activated.
Next you'll create an item provider and register the group activity on it.
You then initialize the UIActivityItemsConfiguration with the item provider.
Finally, you'll need to make sure that the configuration exposes the right metadata, since that is what will be presented in the Share menu.
To do that, you can use the metadataProvider on UIActivityItemsConfiguration and provide an LPLinkMetadata object for the LinkPresentationMetadata key.
The title and image provider will be used in the Share menu.
All of this will also work if you use your own class that conforms to UIActivityItemsConfigurationReading.
